# µPIT
## The Free, Easy-To-Use Unreal Engine Plugin Installation Tool By HowToCompute.

### What Is µPIT?
µPIT (also known as uPIT) is an easy-to-use utility that allows you to install unreal engine plugins to your engine. It works for both Windows and Linux, and has advanced caphabilities like detecting binary builds (on windows) and generating plugin binaries during the install procedure (will ask you first, and will require the build tools).

### How Do I Obtain µPIT?
µPIT can easily be obtained by heading to the releases tab and downloading the latest (stable) release. µPIT binaries have been tested on Windows 7/10 (on the Windows side) and on Arch Linux (on the Linux side). If you're experiencing any issues, please open up an issue so I can look into this.

### I'm Having A Problem!
Please open up an issue using github's built-in system. This makes it easy to keep track of bugs, and will allow you to see if anyone else has already experienced the issue before you

### Are There Any Tutorials?
We're working on them!

### I'd Like To Suggest A Feature!
Please consider opening up an issue so we can keep track of all of the feature suggestions in one single place.

### What Are The Future Development Plans For µPIT?
We're planning on creating a plugin browser. This way plugin developers can submit their github repo's, and binaries so you, as a user, can expect a seamless install process. We're currently still working on this, and aren't done with this feature yet. If you're a plugin developer that would like your plugin listed in the index when this update comes out, please stay tuned for future announcements!
